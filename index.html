        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>The opioid epidemic has devastated communities across the United States, with Connecticut experiencing particularly severe impacts. Our project, "Visualizing Drug Overdoses in Connecticut," seeks to illuminate this public health crisis through comprehensive data analysis and interactive visualizations. By examining accidental drug-related deaths from 2012 to 2023, we aim to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identify geographical hotspots of overdose incidents across Connecticut counties</li>
            <li>Analyze demographic trends among victims (age, race, gender)</li>
            <li>Track temporal patterns in overdose rates over the 11-year period</li>
            <li>Examine correlations between specific substances and fatal outcomes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our visualizations will serve as powerful tools for policymakers, healthcare providers, and community organizations to develop targeted interventions and allocate resources effectively. The project combines data science techniques with compelling visual storytelling to create awareness and drive meaningful action.</p>

        <h2>Dataset</h2>
        <p>Our primary dataset is sourced from the <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/accidental-drug-related-deaths-2012-2018" target="_blank">Connecticut Office of the Chief Medical Examiner</a> via Data.gov. This comprehensive record contains:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>11,973 cases</strong> of accidental drug-related deaths (2012-2023)</li>
            <li><strong>48 attributes</strong> per case, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>Victim demographics (age, race, gender, residence)</li>
                    <li>Incident details (date, location, county)</li>
                    <li>Toxicology reports (primary and contributing substances)</li>
                    <li>Medical examiner determinations</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Data preprocessing will involve cleaning inconsistent entries, standardizing categorical variables (particularly for race and substance classifications), and creating derived features like age groups and temporal aggregates. We'll also geocode location data to enable spatial analysis.</p>

        <h2>Research Context</h2>
        <p>The opioid crisis represents one of the most complex public health challenges of our time. In Connecticut alone, overdose deaths have increased by over 300% since 2012, with synthetic opioids like fentanyl now driving the majority of fatalities. Our visualizations build upon existing research while providing new insights through:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Interactive exploration of demographic disparities</li>
            <li>Spatiotemporal analysis of emerging hotspots</li>
            <li>Comparative examination of substance combinations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Key reference materials that inform our approach include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/dph/injury-and-violence-prevention/injuryfactsheets/2022-fact-sheet_unintentional-fatal-drug-overdoses_updated-on-6-7-2023.pdf" target="_blank">Connecticut Department of Public Health Report</a> - Provides state-specific surveillance data and prevention strategies</li>
            <li><a href="https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates" target="_blank">NIDA Overdose Death Rates</a> - Offers national context and research frameworks</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Methodological Approach</h2>
        <p>Our analysis employs a multi-phase methodology:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Data Preparation:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Handling missing values and inconsistent entries</li>
                    <li>Standardizing categorical variables (e.g., combining "White" and "white" entries)</li>
                    <li>Creating derived features (age groups, year/month aggregates)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Exploratory Analysis:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Statistical profiling of key variables</li>
                    <li>Identification of outlier cases</li>
                    <li>Temporal and spatial pattern detection</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Visualization Development:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heatmaps for geographical concentration</li>
                    <li>Time-series charts for trend analysis</li>
                    <li>Demographic breakdowns using bar/stacked charts</li>
                    <li>Interactive features for user-driven exploration</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>All visualizations will be implemented using a combination of Altair and D3.js to balance analytical depth with user engagement.</p>

        <h2>Anticipated Insights</h2>
        <p>Our preliminary analysis suggests several critical findings that will be explored in depth:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Geographical Patterns:</strong> Early data shows concentration in urban counties (Hartford, New Haven) with emerging rural hotspots</li>
            <li><strong>Demographic Shifts:</strong> Increasing rates among younger age groups and communities of color</li>
            <li><strong>Temporal Trends:</strong> Acceleration of deaths post-2016 coinciding with fentanyl proliferation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These insights will be presented through coordinated visualizations that allow users to explore the data from multiple perspectives while maintaining narrative coherence.</p>
