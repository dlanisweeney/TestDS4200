            <h3>Data Interpretation</h3>
            <p>The interactive heatmap reveals stark geographical disparities in overdose fatalities across Connecticut counties from 2012-2023:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>New Haven County</strong> leads with 2,901 deaths - 24.2% of statewide fatalities</li>
                <li><strong>Hartford County</strong> follows closely with 2,652 deaths (22.1%)</li>
                <li><strong>Fairfield County</strong> accounts for 1,564 deaths (13.1%)</li>
                <li>The remaining five counties combined represent 40.6% of deaths</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Key Findings</h3>
            <p>The visualization demonstrates three critical patterns:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Urban Concentration:</strong> 59.3% of deaths occur in the two most populous counties (New Haven and Hartford), suggesting correlation between population density and overdose incidence</li>
                <li><strong>Regional Disparities:</strong> The southeast coastal region (New London) shows unexpectedly high rates given its population size</li>
                <li><strong>Rural Emergence:</strong> While absolute numbers are lower, per capita rates in Windham and Litchfield counties indicate growing rural impacts</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Professional Applications</h3>
            <p>This heatmap serves multiple stakeholders:</p>
            <table class="stakeholder-table">
                <tr>
                    <th>Stakeholder</th>
                    <th>Application</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Public Health Officials</td>
                    <td>Target harm reduction resources to geographical hotspots</td>

                <tr>

                    <td>Medical Providers</td>
                    <td>Identify high-risk areas for naloxone distribution and treatment facilities</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Researchers</td>
                    <td>Guide further investigation into socioeconomic factors driving spatial patterns</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            
            <div class="takeaway">
                <h3>Visualization Takeaway</h3>
                <p>The heatmap powerfully demonstrates that overdose deaths are not evenly distributed across Connecticut but instead cluster in specific urban centers while showing concerning growth in rural areas. This spatial analysis suggests that while population density is a factor, other elements like economic conditions, access to treatment, and drug distribution networks likely contribute to these geographical patterns. The immediate visual impact of the color gradient makes clear which regions require urgent intervention, while the interactive elements allow professionals to explore specific county data for targeted planning.</p>

    <!-- Design Explanation for Word Doc (commented for HTML) -->
    <!--
    <div style="display:none;">
        <h3>Design Rationale (for Word Document)</h3>
        <p>The heatmap employs a purple-to-red color gradient to represent overdose counts, chosen for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Visual Accessibility:</strong> The gradient provides clear differentiation even for colorblind viewers</li>
            <li><strong>Emotional Impact:</strong> Warmer colors intuitively signal higher danger levels</li>
            <li><strong>Interactive Features:</strong> Tooltips showing exact death counts appear on hover, while click events could be implemented to drill down to yearly data</li>
            <li><strong>Geographical Context:</strong> County boundaries are outlined in white to maintain visibility against the color gradient</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The design prioritizes immediate pattern recognition while supporting deeper investigation through interaction. The legend's stepped color thresholds (rather than continuous) help viewers quickly categorize counties by severity level. Future enhancements could include temporal sliders to show evolution of hotspots over time.</p>
